# Hints for development:

With the current perlmod, the `.pm` files don't actually change anymore, since the exported method
setup is now handled by the bootstrap rust-function generated by perlmod, so for quicker debugging,
you can just keep the installed `.pm` files from the package and simply link the library to the
debug one like so:

NOTE: You may need to adapt the perl version number in this path:
```
# ln -sf $PWD/target/debug/libpve_rs.so /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/perl5/5.32/auto/libpve_rs.so
```

Then just restart pvedaemon/pveproxy after running `make pve`.
